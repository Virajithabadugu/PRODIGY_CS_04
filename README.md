# Task 4: Simple Keylogger
Developed a basic keylogger program in Python that records and logs keystrokes.
# How to Use:
1. Run the script.
2. The keylogger will start recording keystrokes and save them to a file named "keylog.txt" in the same directory as the script.
3. Press 'Esc' to stop the keylogger.
4. # Ethical Considerations:
Ensure you have explicit permission before deploying such tools. The use of keyloggers can raise ethical concerns and may be illegal without proper authorization.
# Disclaimer:
This keylogger is for educational purposes only.
